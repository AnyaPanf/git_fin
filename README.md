# Hi!

I'm Anya and I'm strugling with this front end development course.

Git module was really great and that's why:

1. The teacher 
2. How structured and clear was the information
3. When I finally understoof how it worked it turned out to so cool!

I'd like to attach a link to my portfolio, but I don't have one... So here is the link to [Google](http://google.com/)

## Thank you, Alena! :)
